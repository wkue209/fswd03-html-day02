	<h1>Song Text by Ed Sheeran</h1>
	<p>
		<div>One night of love</div>

		<span>Is not enough
		Don't let me breath
		You won't believe
		I fell in love next to you
		Burning fires in this room</span>

		<div>
		It just fits, light and smooth
		Like my feet in my shoes
		Little one, lie with me
		<span>Sew you heart to my sleeve</span>
		We'll stay quiet underneath
		Shooting stars if it helps you sleep</div>

		<div>
		Oooh Oooh
		There's a firefly,
		There's a firefly
		Gonna burn this place down
		There's a firefly
		</div>
